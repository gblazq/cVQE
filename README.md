cVQE is a collection of classes to run Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
with quadratic Hamiltonians on compressed space.
It provides variational forms, converters and initial states to be used with Qiskit Aqua's
algorithms.

TODO:

* Fix problem with Gradients.
* Make `QuadraticOperatorReducer` return the operator, not its density.
* Add tests.
* Improve the examples.
* Improve the README.md file.
